<h1>RU58841 vs RAD150: Hair Gains or Muscle Gains?</h1>

<p>Iâ€™ve run both <strong>RU58841</strong> and <strong>RAD150</strong>. One saved my hair. The other packed on slabs of muscle. If you're stuck choosing between the two, you first need to ask yourself: do you want to keep your hairline or max out your gains?</p>

<p>This isnâ€™t theory or bro science. Iâ€™ve personally used both. Below is my breakdown of exactly how each worked for me, the side effects I ran into, and who should use what.</p>

<h2>How I Tested These Compounds</h2>
<p>To keep things fair, I didnâ€™t stack either with anything else. Here's what I looked at:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Results (muscle gain or hair retention)</li>
  <li>Side effects (suppression, shedding, sleep, etc.)</li>
  <li>Application (oral vs topical, ease of use)</li>
</ul>
<p>Letâ€™s dive into each compound.</p>

<h2>What Is RU58841?</h2>
<p><strong>RU58841</strong> is a topical anti-androgen. It works locally on the scalp to block DHTâ€”the hormone responsible for male pattern baldness. It doesnâ€™t go systemic like finasteride, so it doesnâ€™t mess with your libido or hormones.</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/ru58841/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RU58841 from Chemyo</a> for 6 months straight, applying it once per day to my temples and crown.</p>

<h3>My RU58841 Results</h3>
<p>I noticed less shedding within 3 weeks. By month 3, the bald spot on my crown started filling in slightly. Hairline didnâ€™t move forward, but it definitely held the line.</p>
<p>The best part? Zero side effects. No brain fog. No libido drop. And no post-finasteride syndrome worries.</p>

<h3>RU58841 Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Stops DHT at the scalp without going systemic</li>
  <li>No suppression or hormonal effects</li>
  <li>Easy to apply, fast-drying</li>
  <li>Starts working within weeks</li>
</ul>

<h3>RU58841 Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Not a muscle enhancerâ€”itâ€™s only for hair</li>
  <li>Needs consistent daily application</li>
  <li>Can be pricey long-term</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Best for:</strong> Hair loss prevention, DHT-sensitive users, maintaining a hairline while on gear</h4>

<h2>What Is RAD150?</h2>
<p><strong>RAD150</strong> is an upgraded version of RAD140. It's esterified for longer half-life and better absorption. Think of it like RAD140â€™s big brotherâ€”stronger, longer-lasting, and even more anabolic. I ran <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/product/rad150-solution/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this RAD150 from Chemyo</a> solo for 8 weeks.</p>

<h3>My RAD150 Results</h3>
<p>RAD150 hit me fast. I noticed more power and aggression in the gym by week 2. My chest and shoulders blew up. I gained around 6â€“7 lbs of lean mass, and my strength on compound lifts climbed hard.</p>
<p>Downside? Sleep got rough around week 5, and my testosterone dippedâ€”had bloodwork to prove it. Needed a mini PCT post-cycle. But the gains were real.</p>

<h3>RAD150 Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Massive strength gains</li>
  <li>Hard, dry muscle with no bloat</li>
  <li>Better stability vs RAD140</li>
  <li>Great for bulking and recomposition</li>
</ul>

<h3>RAD150 Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Suppressionâ€”blood levels dropped</li>
  <li>Sleep disruption around week 5â€“6</li>
  <li>Not ideal if youâ€™re prone to hair loss (increased androgen activity)</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Best for:</strong> Bulking, strength cycles, size without fat</h4>
